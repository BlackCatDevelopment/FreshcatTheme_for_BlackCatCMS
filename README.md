# FreshcatTheme_for_BlackCatCMS

This is the development repository for the freshcat Backend Theme that is
delivered with BlackCat CMS. While this repository contains a bunch of single
CSS and JS files, the release version that is contained in the BlackCatCMS
repository itself contains minimized files.

This repository is for development only, there will be no releases and no need
to download and install it. ;)
